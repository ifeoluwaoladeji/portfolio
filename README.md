## Projects
### Creating a Hospital Database using MySQL
Let's explore the intricacies of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a hospital database. This diagram is a visual representation of the data model, illustrating how various entities within the hospital environment interact with each other. Understanding this will give profound insights into data flow and management in a healthcare setting.
My Final Thoughts:
Understanding the ER diagram of a hospital database isn't just about technical comprehensionâ€”it's about appreciating the intricate dance of data that supports patient care and hospital operations. This framework ensures that every piece of information is accessible, accurate, and interconnected, ultimately enhancing the health outcomes of patients.

### Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

Used **Python** to analyze the breast cancer data set I got from Kaggle (Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data set) I first understood my dataset after I did the data processing, Encoding the Target Variable, Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets, Feature Scaling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Training Model, Prediction System and Save Model
